Installing iRemoteWipe
======================

Requirements
------------

iRemoteWipe runs on PHP5. I've tested only on Snow Leopard(MacOS X 10.6).


How to install
--------------

To Install iRemoteWipe, simply do the follwoing commands.

% configure   <DOCROOT>  <CONF_DIR>
% sudo make install

<DOCROOT>  : path to web server's document root directory
<CONF_DIR> : path to apache httpd.conf (ex: /etc/apache2)

It adds the following Alias Directive into your httpd.conf.

Alias /Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync /var/www/z-push/index.php

Lastly, make sure that PHP has the following settings:

php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off
php_flag register_globals off
php_flag magic_quotes_runtime off
php_flag short_open_tag on


Setting up your iPhone
------------------------

This is simply a case of adding an 'Exchange Server' to your iPhone
Mail/Calendar/Contact list, specifying machine name of iRemoteWipe 
apache server, disabling SSL, unless you have already setup SSL on your 
Apache server, setting the correct username & password (the domain is ignored, 
you can keep it blank), and then you should be enable only "Contact" settings.

Once you have done this, you will see a contact group says "Dummy" in your 
contact list.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Most problems will be caused by incorrect Apache settings. To test whether
your Apache setup is working correctly, you can simply type the following URL
in your browser, to see if apache is correctly redirecting your request to
z-push. You can simply use:

http://<serverip>/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync

If correctly configured, you should see a username/password request, and
when you specify a valid username & password, you should see a string like

"This is the z-push location and can only be accessed by Microsoft ActiveSync-capable devices."

If not, then check your PHP and Apache settings.

If you have other synchronisation problems, you can create the file
'debug.txt' in the root directory of z-push, which should also be
world-writable:

touch /Library/WebServer/Documents/z-push/debug.txt
chmod 777 /Library/WebServer/Documents/z-push/debug.txt

The debug.txt file will then collect debug information from your
synchronisation.
